# Lights &  Ceiling Fans

I would **HIGHLY** recommend Lutron wall switches. They are bulletproof.

> Things to keep in mind: Lutron Caseta only supports <=50 devices (PICOs, switches, etc.).

> Lutron RadioRA supports more and supports ceilings fans, but is more expensive.

> There IS a middle ground with RadioRa Select

Use the [Lutron RadioRa Select](https://www.literitecontrols.com/product/connect-bdg2-1-radio-ra2-connect-bridge/) in order to control lights and ceiling fans at the switch. The bridge model number is **CONNECT-BDG2-1**. Then [integrate](https://www.home-assistant.io/components/lutron/) it into Home Assistant.
