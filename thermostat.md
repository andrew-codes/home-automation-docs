# Thermostats

> I would **NOT** buy a Nest; [Google is discontinuing Works With Nest](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/9/18537331/google-nest-cancellation-assistant-smart-home-integration-report).

I have not looked into a specific thermostat yet. I will buy one that is compatible with Home Assistant (virtually any z-wave/zigbee thermostat). I would recommend buying one that not only is automate-able but looks nice.
