# Locks

I would recommend a lock that

- has a keycode PIN pad
- supports Bluetooth.

Why both? PIN numbers mean that you can give/revoke numbers to guests and they do NOT have to have a special app on their phone.

> I have found that no guests use the August app.

You can set up Home Assistant to [enable entering/deleting user codes](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/zwave-lock-manager/79252) for a lock or create one time codes. I would want to Bluetooth for myself, so I do not have to enter a PIN number. The lock I was eyeballing is either the [keyless one](https://www.amazon.com/Yale-Security-YRD256-CBA-619-Connected-Touchscreen/dp/B07GQ2VLSD/ref=sxin_5_osp3-81ee9722_cov?ascsubtag=81ee9722-6891-4264-b784-91b5add4f431&creativeASIN=B07GQ2VLSD&cv_ct_id=amzn1.osp.81ee9722-6891-4264-b784-91b5add4f431&cv_ct_pg=search&cv_ct_wn=osp-search&keywords=door+lock&linkCode=oas&pd_rd_i=B07GQ2VLSD&pd_rd_r=45161c7e-9d73-41b4-bcce-e1c13a960ef3&pd_rd_w=ANt81&pd_rd_wg=RDuWZ&pf_rd_p=53eff971-6e12-4016-9864-b6dfd929b2b3&pf_rd_r=ZSF9ZTA6QSGTZ4598536&qid=1568316401&s=gateway&tag=imoreosp-20) (has a backup battery instead) or a [keyed one](https://www.amazon.com/Yale-Security-YRD226-CBA-619-Connected-Touchscreen/dp/B07GQ372JP/ref=pd_bxgy_60_img_2/133-2689850-1026538?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07GQ372JP&pd_rd_r=aaebcc65-251f-43eb-a214-437255b13c67&pd_rd_w=r4qQ9&pd_rd_wg=B5ftM&pf_rd_p=a2006322-0bc0-4db9-a08e-d168c18ce6f0&pf_rd_r=A5V2CXCG5S2HVVG46A2E&psc=1&refRID=A5V2CXCG5S2HVVG46A2E) (for backup purposes).
