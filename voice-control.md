# Voice Control

I intend to train my own, on-device, voice assistant using [Snips.ai](https://snips.ai/). The voice assistant will run on the NUC and Iâ€™m going to build Echo Dot look-a-likes as satellites that connect to it.

> The hard part is finding a case.

I am currently looking to find a design online and have it 3D printed by a company with nicer materials OR find a student/etc. to make a 3D model to print from a company. I cannot give a lot of insight into this yet as I have not started the implementation. It could be built with a raspberry pi or other things. I also want to run the satellites and snips.ai hub as containers on the NUC.

Here is an [example with a tutorial](https://vimeo.com/213671278) I found that looks fairly nice that I will likely emulate.

> The voice satellites could also run on the same Pis as the [multi-room audio clients](multi-room-audio.md).
