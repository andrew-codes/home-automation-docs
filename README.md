# My Home Automation Notes

## Goals

1. Require as few phone apps to control the home as possible (ideally just a single app)
2. Device control, automation rules, etc. are as centralized as possible; versus stringing multiple services together in tandem to accomplish an automation/control a device
3. Isolate services and their setup from another; favor containerization
4. Multi-room audio; primarily streaming from Spotify
5. Voice control with privacy (no Amazon, Google, or Apple services listening)
